# FileEater
A malicious C program that looks like a snake game, but is actually a backdoor that is capable of scanning and corrupting files.
FileEater was built by Sarim Ahmed, Muntaha Adnan and Shaheer Adnan at FAST NU (Karachi) as thier first semester project.

## Details
There are two programs, a minigame and a backdoor host. The minigame uses multithreading to run a snake game in the front while doing maliciious operations in the back. For example connecting to the attacker's machine, listening for orders, scanning and eating the victim's files.
